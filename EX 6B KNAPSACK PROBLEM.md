# EX 6B KNAPSACK PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To demonstrate a python program using dynamic programming for 0/1 knapsack problem.



## Algorithm
1. Create a DP table K[n+1][W+1], initialized to 0.
2. Iterate over items i from 0 to n and capacities w from 0 to W:
        If i == 0 or w == 0, set K[i][w] = 0 (base case).
        If current weight wt[i-1] ≤ w, set K[i][w] = max(val[i-1] + K[i-1][w - wt[i-1]], K[i-1][w]).
        Else, set K[i][w] = K[i-1][w].
3. Return K[n][W] as the maximum value.

            if i == 0 or w == 0:
                K[i][w] = 0
            elif wt[i-1] <= w:
                K[i][w] = max(val[i-1]+ K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]],K[i-1][w])
            else:
                K[i][w] = K[i-1][w]
 
    return K[n][W]

x=int(input())
y=int(input())
W=int(input())
val=[]
wt=[]
for i in range(x):
    val.append(int(input()))
for y in range(y):
    wt.append(int(input()))

n = len(val)
print('The maximum value that can be put in a knapsack of capacity W is: ',knapSack(W, wt, val, n))
```

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding the maximum value that can be put in a knap sack of capacity .
